      <h3 class="paragraphs">
        Edward was born in a small town named Resembool in the nation of Amestris, living with his younger brother
        Alphonse and their parents Trisha Elric and Van Hohenheim. After Hohenheim left the family on a trip early in
        their
        lives, Edward developed a hatred for their father as he and Alphonse learned to use magic (with chemicals)
        before
        Trisha died of an illness years later. This two young boys (focused mental and physical effort) on studying
        magic
        (with chemicals) in the hopes of bringing their mother back to life, and trained with a skilled (person who
        believed
        in magic with chemicals) named Izumi Curtis. When they make the attempt to (bring back to life) their mother, it
        failed
        and the brothers paid a bigger price via the Law of Equal Exchange: which states that every result needs/demands
        an equal
        payment.
      </h3>
      <h3 class="paragraphs">
        Edward lost his left leg while meeting the knowledge-based being known as Truth, gaining great knowledge as
        well as the huge (amounts of) ability to perform changes just by clapping his hands together without the need of
        a
        Change Circle. As Alphonse's whole being was taken by Truth, Edward uses his newly gained knowledge in
        sacrificing his
        own right arm to retrieve Alphonse's soul and bind it to a nearby suit of (protective metal or other covering).
        Later meeting Colonel Roy Mustang while being outfitted (artificial leg, arm, etc.) "automail" limbs by the
        grandmother
        of his (related to the time when a person is a child) friend, Winry Rockbell, he became (gave a reason to do
        something)
        to restore Alphonse, Edward joins the State Military. He becomes the youngest State (person who believed in
        magic with
        chemicals), receiving the title of "Fullmetal (person who believed in magic with chemicals)" shortly after that
        from
        the military head, Fuhrer-King Bradley. For the next few years, the Elric Brothers begin a long/big search for
        the
        famous (someone who thinks a lot about how people think)'s Stone in order to restore their bodies.
      </h3>

      <h3 class="paragraphs">
        Edward is very (expecting that everything will work out perfectly), and strongly believes in the alchemical idea
        of "Equal Exchange," though he also behaves in a childish manner and can violently express anger/be violent when
        angrily faced/stood up to about his short height. Besides his abilities as a (person who believed in magic with
        chemicals), Edward is a difficult/impressively strong fighter as a result of his training with Izumi, who had a
        lot trained both brothers in martial arts.
