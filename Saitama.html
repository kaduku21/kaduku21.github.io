      A 22-year-old, unemployed Japanese guy who wants to become a superhero.

      But he knows to become a superhero, he had to become stronger. It could only be done by an intense training
      regime.

      Once returning from a rejected job interview, he ran into Crablante, a Mysterious Being who turned into a humanoid
      crab after eating too much crab and undergoing a metamorphosis.

      Crablante was about to eat someone and Saitama saves him. After a conquest, Saitama pulls out the eye of the
      Crablante with his tie and defeats the crabman. It motivates Saitama to follow his dream and become a superhero.

      Thats when the Saitama Workout was invented.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="paragraphs">
      However, Saitama has a dark side.
      Despite being the strongest man, Saitama was unhappy. He was so strong that he could defeat an enemy with one
      punch. There was no challenge unto him, which made him empty inside and his life less-fulfilling.
      Saitama followed a workout plan for three years and became the world’s strongest man.

      He did the workout every single day. After one and a half years, he became so strong that he lost his hair. But
      that didn’t stop him. He realized that he was becoming super-hero.

      But what is the Saitama Workout?
